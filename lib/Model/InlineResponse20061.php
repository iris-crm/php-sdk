The tokens are generated in the CRM by each user individually, and each user may create one or more tokens.  To generate a new API Token, open your user settings page by clicking on your username in the top-right corner, and clicking on the ** Settings ** link or you can use the link.  `[CLIENT URL HERE]/settings`  Then open the ** API Settings ** tab, click ** Create New API Token **, configure your token’s settings as needed, and click ** Add New Token **:  <img src='images/docs/mapi001.png'/>  Your new token will now be created and displayed in a popup window:  <img src='images/docs/mapi002.png'/>  Once the token is created, it will be shown in the list of available API Tokens where you can copy the token, update its settings, or delete it once it’s no longer needed:  <img src='images/docs/mapi003.png'/>  ** Note: ** The created tokens will inherit the user’s permissions to assigned merchants, leads, groups and processors. # Using the API Authentication to the API is performed via `X-API-KEY` header. Requests not properly authenticated will return a `401` error code.  `curl -X GET \"[CLIENT URL HERE]/api/v1/leads\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"X-API-KEY: [YOURKEY]\"`  Note that all requests should be made over `SSL`. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.  The API returns standard HTTP success or error status codes. In case of errors, additional information about what went wrong will be encoded in the response as JSON.  By default, you can make `120` requests per minute. Check the returned HTTP headers of any API request to see your current rate limit status.  Each GET \"List\" request will return 1,000 matching results.  A maximum of 120,000 results can be returned per minute using a pagination parameter in these requests. # Using the Subscription API API Subscriptions are used to send information about an event to a URL and trigger an API call. This is more efficient than doing scheduled API calls.  To create a subscription, use the API Settings page or send a request using the instructions in the Subscriptions section below.  All you need to know is the events you want to be subscribed for and the url to which the updates need to be sent.  To create subscriptions using our GUI open tab ** API Settings ** at ** `[CLIENT URL HERE]/settings` **:  <img src='images/docs/new-subscription.png'/> # Authentication Authenticate your account by including your secret key in API requests. Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas, client-side code, and so forth. Authentication to the API is performed via `X-API-KEY` header. Requests not properly authenticated will return a `401` error code. # Errors Our API returns standard `HTTP` success or error status codes. For errors, we will also include extra information about what went wrong encoded in the response as `JSON`. # Limiting You can make `120` requests per minute. If you will reach a limit you will get a `429: Too Many Attempts.` response from the server. Check the returned `HTTP` headers of any API request to see your current rate limit status. Headers description: * `X-RateLimit-Limit` tells you the max number of requests you're allowed to make within this application's time period * `X-RateLimit-Remaining` tells you how many requests you have left within this current time period * `Retry-After` tells you how many seconds to wait until you try again. (you'll only get `Retry-After` if you've hit the limit).   # PHP SDK  ### Installation and Usage  #### Availability  The IRIS CRM PHP SDK requires PHP version 5.5 or higher and the PHP cURL extension.  #### Composer  To install the bindings via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), please run:  ```bash  composer require iris-crm/php-sdk      ```   In your code, configure the environment and API credentials:  ```php require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');  use Swagger\\Client\\Configuration; use Swagger\\Client\\Api\\LeadsApi;  // Configure API key authorization $config = Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration() ->setApiKey('X-API-KEY', 'YOUR_API_KEY') ->setHost('https://iriscrm.com/api/v1/'); ``` Here’s an example of how to get a list of leads using an SDK. Swagger\\Client\\Api\\LeadsApi it's a SDK Class for Lead endpoints. ```php $apiInstance = new LeadsApi(null, $config);  $page        = 1; // int | Page number $sort_by     = \"created\"; // string | Sorting of leads by the field value $sort_dir    = \"asc\"; // string | Direction of sorting $group       = 2; // int | Filter leads by a group id $campaign    = 3; // int | Filter leads by a campaign id $source      = 4; // int | Filter leads by a source id $status      = 1; // int | Filter leads by a status id $category    = 1; // int | Filter leads by a status category id $user        = 12; // int | Filter leads by a user id $date_filter = \"created\"; // string | Filtering leads by a date range depends on this filter $start_date  = new \\DateTime(\"2018-10-20T19:20:30+01:00\"); // \\DateTime | Filter leads by a date in ISO 8601 format (Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:sP) $end_date    = new \\DateTime(\"2019-10-20T19:20:30+01:00\"); // \\DateTime | Filter leads by a date in ISO 8601 format (Y-m-d\\\\TH:i:sP) $email       = \"test@mail.com\"; // string | Filter leads by a email try {     $result = $apiInstance->leadsGet($page, $sort_by, $sort_dir, $group, $campaign, $source, $status, $category, $user, $date_filter, $start_date, $end_date, $email);     print_r($result); } catch (Exception $e) {     echo 'Exception when calling LeadsApi->leadsGet: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL; } ``` All parameters for leadsGet method is optional and can be skipped.  If you want skip some parameters - you need to set parameter to `null`  All available classes and methods you can get in \"API Endpoints\" section below. ### API Endpoints All URIs are relative to
